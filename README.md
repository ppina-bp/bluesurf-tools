# bluesurf-tools

Local Blue Surf client and agent skills (Cursor, Codex, Claude Code). They replay **your** SSO session in a dedicated Chromium profile. There is no public API and no password handling.

This workflow is **opinionated to me (Pato Piña / patopiña)**. After a ticket is pulled, agents follow [Matt Pocock’s engineering skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) — grill → spec → tickets → implement with TDD → review — plus the Blue Surf skills below. That routing is mine; it is not a generic Surf or Blue People process.

Cursor user rules that drive it live in [`rules/`](rules/). Blue Surf skills live in [`skills/`](skills/) and are linked into `~/.agents/skills` (also `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.cursor/skills`). Use them in a **new chat**. If the session is dead, run `npm run login` here first.

Design notes: [docs/design.md](docs/design.md). Full install: [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

## Setup

On a new machine, follow **[docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md)** — clone, Surf login, Matt Pocock skills, Blue Surf skill links, then the Cursor/Codex rules.

If this machine is already set up and you only need the Surf session:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/bluesurf-tools
npm run login
```

Complete SSO in the window that opens. It saves the session to `.surf-cookies.json` and closes by itself once you are signed in. After that, every command runs headless — no window.

When the session expires, the skills run `npm run login` for you: a window opens, you sign in, and the agent retries the command.

`.env` points at `https://surf.bluepeople.com` and the BluePeople Obsidian vault (`RLand/Tickets`, `RLand/Sprints`).

## `/bluesurf-ticket`

Pull one Surf work item into Obsidian, then stop. A ticket tagged Bugs Detected carries regression comments to fix. Any other ticket waits until you choose grill or implement.

**Say:** `/bluesurf-ticket RLD-336`, or “pull RLD-336”.

**Does:**

1. Reuses the saved session in headless Chromium.
2. Writes `RLand/Tickets/RLD-336/detail.md` (title, priority, type, status, sprint, estimate, tags, attachment names, HTML description). A `Bugs Detected` tag also writes the comments.
3. Downloads files into `RLand/Tickets/RLD-336/attachments/`.
4. Stops. On `Bugs Detected`, the comments are the regressions to fix. Otherwise asks **grill vs implement**.

**Complete the ticket** when the work is finished:

| You say | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| “The ticket is complete” | Deletes `RLand/Tickets/RLD-336/` from the vault. |
| “Commit and push” | Commits the **implementation repo** with `(RLD-336)` at the end of the subject, pushes that branch, then deletes the vault folder. That phrase is push permission for this ticket. |

Same as the CLIs:

```bash
npm run ticket -- RLD-336
npm run ticket-done -- RLD-336
```

## `/bluesurf-sprint`

Snapshot your assigned tickets on the current Surf sprint into Obsidian.

**Say:** `/bluesurf-sprint`, “sprint note”, or “current sprint”.

**Does:**

1. Opens Chromium briefly to reuse the saved session.
2. Loads tickets assigned to you on the latest sprint (highest-numbered `currentSprintName` on your cards; falls back to the most common `currentSprintId` if names have no number).
3. For each ticket, reads reported hours from the work item (`totalExecuted`), not the board’s inflated `totalHours`.
4. Writes or **rewrites** the note for that sprint (same file if Sprint 14 was already captured).

**Vault file:** `RLand/Sprints/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (first capture), then the same path is updated on later runs.

**Tables:**

- **Pending Tickets** — `Development (IN PROGRESS)`, `Analysis (IN PROGRESS)`, `Analysis (DONE)`, and any `BLOCKED` status
- **Done Tickets** — everything else

Each table is ordered by priority. Columns: ticket (wiki link to `<OBSIDIAN_TICKETS_DIR>/RLD-xxx/detail`), title, estimate, effort (hours already reported), type, status, priority, tags.

Does not pull a single ticket unless you ask.

```bash
npm run sprint
npm run sprint -- RLD 2026-09-16
```

## `/bluesurf-move`

Move a ticket to another status on the board. The team sees the change, so the skill always previews and asks first.

**Say:** “move RLD-388 to dev done”, “I finished 388”, “mark 387 as blocked”.

**Does:** looks up the ticket's type (each type has its own board and status ids), matches the status name loosely, and prints the planned move. With `--yes` it moves the card to the top of that column (`POST /api/WorkItem/{id}/moveOnBoard/{statusId}/0`), checks Surf's answer, and sends the `ProjectUpdated` hub message the board UI sends so teammates' open boards refresh.

```bash
npm run move -- RLD-388 "dev done"         # preview only, changes nothing
npm run move -- RLD-388 "dev done" --yes   # move it
```

## `/bluesurf-mine`

List the tickets assigned to you across **every** sprint. Read-only; nothing is written to the vault.

**Say:** `/bluesurf-mine`, “my tickets”, or “what’s assigned to me”.

**Does:** loads your assigned cards, hides any `DONE` status, and groups the rest by sprint (newest first, no sprint last), ordered by priority. Agents call it with `--json`.

```bash
npm run mine            # open tickets
npm run mine -- --all   # include DONE
npm run mine -- --json  # machine-readable, for agents
```

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run login` | Sign in once; saves the session to `.surf-cookies.json` |
| `npm run ticket -- RLD-336` | Write ticket note + attachments |
| `npm run ticket-done -- RLD-336` | Delete that ticket folder from the vault |
| `npm run sprint` | Write or rewrite the current-sprint note |
| `npm run move -- RLD-388 "dev done"` | Preview a status move; add `--yes` to move |
| `npm run mine` | List your open tickets across all sprints (`--all`, `--json`) |
| `npm test` | Unit tests |
| `npm run spike` | Record Surf XHR (only if the API map in `docs/design.md` is stale) |

## Safety

- Do not commit `.chrome-profile/`, `.surf-cookies.json`, `.scratch/`, or `.env` (`.surf-cookies.json` is your live Surf session; it is written with mode 600)
- Share this repo by **git clone**, not by copying the whole checkout folder (that folder can hold your session and spike captures)
- `BLUESURF_HEADED=1` shows the browser window, for debugging
- Do not put passwords in this repo
- Never `POST /api/login` from our code
- Never push unless you explicitly ask (or say **commit and push** on a pulled ticket)
- Prefer the **skills** for move and ticket completion: `bluesurf-move` previews and asks before changing the board; raw `npm run move … --yes` skips that guardrail

### For colleagues

Each person clones the repo, copies `.env.example` to `.env`, sets their own `OBSIDIAN_VAULT`, and runs `npm run login` so the Surf session stays on their machine. Link the skills from [`docs/setup.md`](docs/setup.md); optional Cursor/Codex rules live in [`rules/`](rules/).

- **Bugs Detected** tickets skip the grill question: the agent implements from the ticket’s **Comments** (copied from Surf). Treat pulled tickets like Surf content you already trust.
- **Attachments** download into the vault under `RLand/Tickets/<code>/attachments/` (your vault may sync via iCloud or similar).
- **Commit and push** on a pulled ticket is explicit permission to push the implementation repo for that ticket.
